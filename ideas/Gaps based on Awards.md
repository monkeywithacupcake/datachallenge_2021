# Gaps based on Awards

_Jess_

## 1. Research question this might answer

What contract opportunities can the fed (or a single agency) not get met?
 - or - what skills/tech is a hole here where we might be reliant on another nation or must raise our willing price?

## 2. Format for product - Tool, Model, Dashboard, Visualization

I'm not sure yet. I think this might be best as an interactive visualization (allowing shifts in time or agency)

## 3. Data set(s) used

Contract opportunities archive 
Department of Labor/Census Bureau business NAICS data?

## 4. Level of perceived difficulty overall

Probably not a big workload - this is mostly just grouping data and creating graphs
No ML or modeling

## 5. Potential roadblocks - known or expected issues with collecting data, cleaning data, analysis, developing product

1. There might not be an interesting story
2. The data that might appear to show an award not being contracted might carry forward to a new award
3. Not sure how well connection between unmet and business data to identify holes

## 6. Notes on evaluation (see project README for evaluation criteria)

TBD

## 7. Why you want to pursue this idea as our project

TBD
